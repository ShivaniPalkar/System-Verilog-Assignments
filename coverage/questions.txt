Question 1: What's the potential problem with using bit in the sample function header? How
can we still use it but address that issue?

Ans: The problem with using bit in the sample funtion is that if either of the variables in the portlist is an output port, 
     the Xs and Zs; if ever encountered will silently be converted into 0s.
     Using isunknown() function on the outputs declared will make sure no unknown values are accepted.


Question 2: Why can't you just treat the four condition codes as a single value using
            concatenation (e.g. {C,N,Z,V}) and build a coverpoint for it along with cross coverage with
            sub? This question has to do with the specific design and not SystemVerilog.  

Ans: A concatenation of the C,V,N,Z codes and building a coverpoint for it along with cross coverage with sub cannot be done as these flags will never be true (1)
     all together and hence the coverage will not hit all the bins even if numerous test cases are generated.
